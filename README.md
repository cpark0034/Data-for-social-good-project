# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a Senior in high school who is interested in going to a renowned college, <br> 
> I want to discover more information about the 8 ivy league schools, <br> 
> so that I can determine the pros and cons of each one. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Example: 

Dataset: https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/cVfmILJswYfIhbY1I2Yjx6xhE_yxsrZ1nr7zYL3pCR8/edit 
- **names** (String) - name of the college 
- **areas** (string) - where each college is located 
- **endowments** (int) - how much funding the college got in 2018
- **academic staff** (int) - how many staff members work at the college

## Description 

Our project uses a dataset called Ivy Leauge Schools. From this dataset we used the colums that had the info on names, locations, funding, and staff. Since our user wanted to get the info to determine what college they want to apply to. We adressed these goals by finding which college gets the most funding, which college has the most staff, and where each ivy leauge school is located.
